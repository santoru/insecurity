Hello There!\
My name is Alessio, and I'm an IT security enthusiast working as a Security Engineer in Berlin, mostly with FinTech companies.\
I previously worked as a penetration tester in Milan where I conducted several activities against web and mobile applications, networks and infrastructures, and devices too (smartphones, laptops, printers, routers, etc).

I like to do security and vulnerability research, bug bounties and writing helpful tools to automate most of my work.

You can find my contacts at the end of this page and a quick summary of my main achievements right above.
